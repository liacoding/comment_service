## About The Project

This project demonstrates the application of fundamental Spring Core concepts in building a straightforward comment service. It exemplifies how to leverage key features of the Spring framework, including Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection, stereotype annotations, and principles of loose coupling to create a modular and maintainable application.

Key Concepts and Features
- Inversion of Control (IoC): Central to the project is the use of IoC, which promotes a more flexible and decoupled architecture by shifting the control of object creation and management to the Spring container.
- Dependency Injection: The project showcases Dependency Injection as a means to inject dependencies into components, fostering a clear separation of concerns and facilitating easier testing and maintenance.
- Stereotype Annotations: Stereotype annotations, such as @Component, @ComponentScan, are utilized to define Spring-managed components and streamline the configuration of the application context.
- Loose Coupling: The design emphasizes loose coupling between components, ensuring that the system is more adaptable to change and enhancing its overall modularity and testability.
